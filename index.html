      <li>My Name is Blake Craig, I am a junior, and I am a Computer Science Major</li>
      <li>I am taking this course because I am extremely curious how websites<br>
      are made and learning what the f12 button executes.</li>
      <li>I have experience in coding from other computer science classes and I<br>
      have made a github website before through Physical Computing.</li>
      <li>My goals for this course are to learn html and to become comfortable<br>
      with web development. I want to be able to apply to web development jobs<br>
      after taking this class.</li>
      <li>The command line is a useful tool for editing documents, files, or folders.<br>
      With a set of commands, you can navigate through your computer. When clicking <br>
      on icons/images on computers, you are just sending a command to the operating <br>
      system. When using the command line, you want to type after your user id and one <br>
      of the symbols used on the number bar when you shift. Here you can print "whoami" <br>
      to display your user id. "pwd" stands for Print Working Directory. This command <br>
      returns your current location within the file system. Using the "ls" command will <br>
      diaplsy a menu of what is within your current directory. You can move between <br>
      directories by using the "cd" command with the location you want to display after.<br>
      You want to make sure that you phrase it like this: "cd ~/Desktop/" if you wanted <br>
      to navigate to the Desktop folder. The squiggly symbol (~) will automatically <br>
      navigate you to the home directory and is the method of going back while using <br>
      the cd command. There are many other commands, but for strictly navigating, <br>
      these are the methods you can use.</li>
