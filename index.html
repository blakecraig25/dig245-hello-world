      <li>My Name is Blake Craig, I am a junior, and I am a Computer Science Major</li>
      <li>I am taking this course because I am extremely curious how websites<br>
      are made and learning what the f12 button executes.</li>
      <li>I have experience in coding from other computer science classes and I<br>
      have made a github website before through Physical Computing.</li>
      <li>My goals for this course are to learn html and to become comfortable<br>
      with web development. I want to be able to apply to web development jobs<br>
      after taking this class.</li>
      <li>What about the command line?</li>
      <li>Look into in a bit lol</li>
