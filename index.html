      <li>My Name is Blake Craig, I am a junior, and I am a Computer Science Major</li>
      <li>I am taking this course because I am extremely curious how websites<br>
      are made and learning what the f12 button executes.</li>
      <li>I have experience in coding from other computer science classes and I<br>
      have made a github website before through Physical Computing.</li>
      <li>My goals for this course are to learn html and to become comfortable<br>
      with web development. I want to be able to apply to web development jobs<br>
      after taking this class.</li>
      <li>The command line is a useful tool for editing documents, files, or folders.<br>
      With a set of commands, you can navigate through your computer. When clicking <br>
      on icons/images on computers, you are just sending a command to the operating <br>
      system. When using the command line, you want to type after your user id and one <br>
      of the symbols used on the number bar when you shift. Here you can print "whoami" <br>
      to display your user id. "pwd" stands for Print Working Directory. This command <br>
      returns your current location within the file system. Using the "ls" command will <br>
      diaplsy a menu of what is within your current directory. You can move between <br>
      directories by using the "cd" command with the location you want to display after.<br>
      You want to make sure that you phrase it like this: "cd ~/Desktop/" if you wanted <br>
      to navigate to the Desktop folder. The squiggly symbol (~) will automatically <br>
      navigate you to the home directory and is the method of going back while using <br>
      the cd command. There are many other commands, but for strictly navigating, <br>
      these are the methods you can use.</li>
      <li>Here are a few examples of Critical Web Design:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://intothetrenches.1917.movie/" target="_blank">Into the Trenches: 1917 Movie</a><br>
          This website enhances the user's experience by creating a 360 degree view of the <br>
          stage design behind the trench scene in 1917 looks like. As a person who loves war <br>
          moveies, I find this website a unique and rewarding experience. It's a great<br>
          advertisement for the movie.</li>
          <li><a href="https://localadventure.mammut.com/en/adventure" target="_blank"> Mammut Adventure Challenge</a> <br>
          The outdoors hosts a need for more durable and reliable equipment. The marketing strategy used by <br>
          Mammut tracks user's data with the goal of creating and rewarding users with high <br>
          quality gear. This website gamifies outdoor activies and encourages people to be outdoors, which I love.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.criticaldanger.com/" target="_blank">Critical Danger</a> is a website that<br>
          brings attention to the way we interact with endangered species. Through their <br>
          unique website design, we learn the goals and mindset about this site. The way <br>
          the colors, design, and especially, the transitions frame the site's <br>
          perspective enhances the user's experience.</li>
        </ul>
